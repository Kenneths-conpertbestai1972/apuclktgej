Just stumbled out of the theater, ears still buzzing like a malfunctioning espresso machine. Drop—what a trip! You know that feeling when you lean too far back in a chair and your heart does a little flip? 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩𝘪𝘯𝘨 Drop felt a lot like that but stretched over two hours. My back aches from the seats, ya know? Not designed for baristas with lumbar needs.

Popcorn... everywhere, like a sea of yellow ants. Why is it so sticky? Sticking to my thoughts like emotional flypaper as that scene with the pigeons exploding into the sky played over in my head. Just like when they spill milk all over the counter and call it art?! 

> The sound, man, like a thousand beans grinding all at once in Dolby surround. Could barely hear myself think. At one point, thought I was in the middle of a coffee rush, orders coming in faster than I could pull them. But then BAM! That twist—felt like discovering a perfect roast in a batch of burnt beans.

Speaking of burnt... that soundtrack! It was simultaneously an orchestra and an espresso machine, the music thrumming in my veins like too much caffeine at 3 PM. And hey, did you remember to 𝘥𝘰𝘸𝘯𝘭𝘰𝘢𝘥 the  ? Seriously, right now, my head is an abstract painting.

Christopher, or was it Nate? Anyway, the protagonist dude, reminds me of that one guy who orders a Quad Grande Americano, no room, no mercy, just pure unadulterated.... oh wait.. the climax reminded me of that time we switched from single-origin Ethiopian to Colombian and forgot to tell the regulars. Pure chaos.

Highlight though? The weird, trippy montage with the slow-motion raindrops—like each drop was a little planet of its own. So meta... Like, honestly, 𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 the   if just for that. The director must have been on something strong, stronger than even our triple ristretto.

ah... I gotta go clean the churner or something. But seriously, the  , def worth your time. Might actually re𝘸𝘢𝘵𝘤𝘩 it after the evening shift...
